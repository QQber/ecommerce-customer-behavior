## Project Description
- The database is from a cosmetics online shop from Dec 2019
- The raw data records what customers have clicked while in an online shop. It includes 4 different events: view, cart,remove from cart and purchase. If the   customer leaves the computer during a session, then for one order can have 2 sessions. It has also recorded time, price, products, user ID for each sessions.
- 2 machine learning moduls been made after data wrapping, but results showed there is no clear correlation between those information. The reason could be: customers are more depending on their subjective consciousness, or one month data is not enough
- Other interesting findings: 
 - 10 a.m. has the highest revenue over a day
                              - Monday has the highest revenue over a week
                              - 9% of customers contribute the whole revenue
                              - 20% top users contribute 56% revenue
