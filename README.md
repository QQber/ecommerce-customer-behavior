## Project Description
1. The database is from a cosmetics online shop from Dec 2019
2. The raw data records what customers have clicked while in an online shop. It includes 4 different events: view, cart,remove from cart and purchase. If the customer leaves the computer during a session,
   then for one order can have 2 sessions. It has also recorded time, price, products, user ID for each sessions.
3. 2 machine learning moduls been made after data wrapping, but results showed there is no clear correlation between those information. The reason could be: customers are more depending on their subjective
   consciousness, or one month data is not enough
4. Other interesting findings: A. 10 a.m. has the highest revenue over a day
                               B. Monday has the highest revenue over a week
                               C. 9% of customers contribute the whole revenue
                               D. 20% top users contribute 56% revenue
